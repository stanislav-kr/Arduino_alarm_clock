## About
This project focuses on creating a multi-functional digital alarm clock with Arduino. The device provides three primary functions: displaying the current local time, operating as an alarm clock, and serving as a Pomodoro timer with a standard 25/5 work‚Äìrest cycle. The clock‚Äôs casing was manufactured using a 3D printer with PETG filament, and the 3D model was designed in FreeCAD. The list of electrical components is provided below. For those interested in the project topology, a link to the PDF documentation will be included.
