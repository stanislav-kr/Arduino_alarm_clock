## About
This project focuses on creating a multi-functional digital alarm clock with Arduino. The device provides three primary functions: displaying the current local time, operating as an alarm clock, and serving as a Pomodoro timer with a standard 25/5 work‚Äìrest cycle. The clock‚Äôs casing was manufactured using a 3D printer with PETG filament, and the 3D model was designed in FreeCAD. The list of electrical components is provided below. For those interested in the project topology, a link to the PDF documentation will be included.

## Conclusion
  A Pomodoro clock is an essential tool for those who want not only to stay focused, but also to maintain high levels of productivity throughout the day. Based on the well-known Pomodoro Technique, it encourages structured work and rest intervals, helping to reduce mental fatigue, improve time management, and build a sustainable workflow over time. Pomodoro clock is an essential tool for those who want not only to stay focused but also to sustain productivity over time using the Pomodoro method.
